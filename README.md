# PMW Website Redesign (Super Seniors)

Rebuild of the Peterson Mobile Woodworking website plus an admin side (CRM, bookings, reporting). CSC 190/191 senior project, Sacramento State.

Jira: [Super Seniors - PMW Website Redesign](https://csus-super-seniors.atlassian.net)

## Stack

- `client/`: React + Vite + TypeScript + React Router + Tailwind CSS
- `server/`: Node.js + Express + TypeScript (all routes under `/api`)
- `shared/`: browser-compatible `@pmw/validation` workspace (Zod schemas and form configuration)
- Tests: Vitest (unit). Playwright is added later (SSPMW-232).
- CI: GitHub Actions runs lint, format check, type check, and tests on every PR to `main`.

## Getting started

Prerequisites: Node.js 22 and Git. Docker Desktop is also needed to run the local Supabase database (`npm run db:start`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CSUS-Super-Seniors/PMW-Website-Redesign-SuperSeniors.git
cd PMW-Website-Redesign-SuperSeniors
npm install
cp server/.env.example server/.env
cp client/.env.example client/.env
```

Run each in its own terminal:

```bash
npm run dev:server   # API on http://localhost:3001 (check /api/health)
npm run dev:client   # site on http://localhost:5173 (proxies /api to the server)
```

## Scripts (run from the repo root)

## Environment variables

Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env`. Never commit `.env` files or keys.

| Variable                    | Purpose                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`                      | API port (default 3001)                                                                     |
| `NODE_ENV`                  | `development` locally                                                                       |
| `CLIENT_ORIGINS`            | Comma-separated origins allowed by CORS (the client, `http://localhost:5173` locally)       |
| `SUPABASE_URL`              | Supabase API URL. For local development, use the URL from `npx supabase status`             |
| `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`  | Supabase publishable (anon) key                                                             |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Supabase service role key. Server only: never use it in `client/` or send it to the browser |

### Client (`client/.env`)

Copy `client/.env.example` to `client/.env`. Only variables that start with `VITE_` reach the browser, so never put the service role key here. Restart `npm run dev:client` after changing it.

| Variable                        | Purpose                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`             | Supabase API URL. Locally, use the URL from `npx supabase status`         |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Supabase publishable key. Locally, use the one from `npx supabase status` |

## Estimate request Step 1 validation (SSPMW-297)

`@pmw/validation` provides the shared Step 1 schema, issue options, TypeScript types, and error
mapping for the client and server. Its source is `shared/src/estimateStep1.ts`.

- Public `POST /api/estimates/validate-step-1` accepts JSON without login and validates without
  saving an inquiry. Valid input returns HTTP 200 with `{ "valid": true }`; invalid schema input
  returns HTTP 400 with `valid: false`, `fieldErrors`, and `formErrors`.
- Client and server `dev`, `build`, `typecheck`, and `test` commands compile the shared package
  automatically.
- After editing shared code while a dev server is running, run
  `npm run build -w @pmw/validation` and restart that dev server.

## Contact messages (SSPMW-268 / SSPMW-364)

Public `POST /api/contact-messages` accepts `name`, `message` (up to 500 characters),
and at least one of `phone` or `email`. The Contact page and API share the email,
phone, and message-length rules. Valid US phones are stored as `+1` followed by
10 digits; empty optional contact fields become SQL `null`.

Set `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` (a verified bare sender address), and
`CONTACT_OWNER_EMAILS` (comma-separated owner addresses) in `server/.env` and the
deployed API environment. Set all three together and restart the API. Empty
recipient entries are ignored; at least one valid address is required. If all
three settings are blank, the contact route is unavailable and other routes run.

HTTP 201 means the message was saved with its creation time. The server then
attempts the plain-text N6 owner notification; failed notifications are logged
with the saved message ID and still return 201, so the page shows receipt instead
of prompting duplicate submissions. Validation failures return 400 with inline
field errors; configuration or save failures return 503. Notification acceptance
does not prove inbox delivery. N9 branding will be adopted when available.

## Database

The schema lives in `supabase/migrations` and is only changed through migration files in a pull request, never by hand in the Supabase dashboard. The `db:migrate` and `db:reset` scripts only touch the local database (`--local`).

### Local Supabase values for `server/.env`

After `npm run db:start`, run `npx supabase status`. It prints the local API URL (`http://127.0.0.1:54321`) and both keys. Copy them into `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. Local Auth redirects go to `http://localhost:5173`, the client dev server.

### Making schema changes

1. `npm run db:start` to start the local database (Docker Desktop must be running).
2. `npm run db:migration -- add_example_table` to create a migration file.
3. Write the SQL in the new file in `supabase/migrations`.
4. `npm run db:migrate` to apply it to your local database. Your local data is kept.
5. Commit the migration file and open a pull request.
6. Optional: `npm run db:reset` to check the schema rebuilds cleanly from every migration. This deletes your local data.

## Design tokens

Colors, fonts, text styles, spacing, radius and shadows come from the Figma design system page and live in `client/src/styles/theme.css`. Run the client and open http://localhost:5173/design-tokens to see them all (development only).

- Colors: `bg-dark-brown`, `text-neutral-600`, `bg-amber`, `border-neutral-300`, and so on. Tailwind's default palette is turned off, so only brand colors exist.
- Text styles: one class per Figma text style, for example `type-h1`, `type-body-lg`, `type-button`, `type-overline`. Use `type-body-lg` for paragraphs on public pages.
- Spacing: Tailwind's normal scale (4px steps) matches Figma, so `p-3` is 12px and `px-20` is 80px.
- Never hard-code hex values or arbitrary colors like `bg-[#123456]`. A test fails the build if you do.

## Contact form preview

In `client/.env`, set `VITE_CONTACT_FORM_STUB=success` or
`VITE_CONTACT_FORM_STUB=failure` and restart `npm run dev:client`.
These development-only previews simulate the sending and result states without
saving or emailing messages. Leave the value empty to use the API.
Production builds always use the API, even if a stub is configured.

## Workflow

1. Pull the latest `main`, then create a branch named after the Jira key: `SSPMW-123-short-description`.
2. Commit with the Jira key in the message, e.g. `SSPMW-123 add estimate form`.
3. Push the branch and open a pull request into `main`. Fill in the PR template.
4. CI must pass and one teammate must approve before merging. Direct pushes to `main` are blocked.

## Deploying (DigitalOcean App Platform)

The deployment configuration is defined in `.do/app.yaml`.

The application has two components:

- `api`: Express backend, listening on port 8080, serving `/api/*`.
- `web`: React/Vite static site, serving `/` with `index.html` as the fallback for client-side routes.

Both components deploy from the `main` branch after changes are merged.

### Before deploying

1. Confirm the DigitalOcean account has the required billing or promotional credits.
2. Connect the `CSUS-Super-Seniors/PMW-Website-Redesign-SuperSeniors` GitHub repository.
3. In DigitalOcean App Platform, select **Create App** and load `.do/app.yaml`.
4. On the create-app environment variables screen, enter the Supabase values **before starting the first deployment**:
   - **API service (runtime):**
     - `SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL.
     - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Supabase service role key (secret).
   - **Web static site (build time):**
     - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL.
     - `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Supabase publishable key.
5. Confirm the environment variables and estimated cost before creating the app.

Never commit real credentials to the repository. The frontend's `VITE_` variables are embedded in the browser build and must never contain the service role key.

The app spec sets `NODE_ENV=production`, `PORT=8080`, and `CLIENT_ORIGINS=${APP_URL}`. Never commit real secret keys.

### After deploying

1. Wait for both components to finish deploying.
2. Visit `https://<app-domain>/api/health` and confirm it returns `{"status":"ok"}`.
3. Open the website and verify that its pages load.
4. Test authentication with the configured Supabase project.
5. Check deployment logs if any checks fail.

### Local verification

From the repository root:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build -w server
npm run build -w client
npm test
```

To verify the API locally, configure the required environment variables, start the backend with `PORT=8080`, and request `http://localhost:8080/api/health`.

## Testing and CI (SSPMW-232)

The client uses Vitest with jsdom and React Testing Library. The server uses Vitest
with Supertest. Playwright runs a real Chromium browser against the local Vite
web server, which Playwright starts automatically. The public homepage smoke test
does not require a running Supabase database or Express API.

From the repository root:

```bash
npm ci
npm test                    # Both workspaces' Vitest suites
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e           # Playwright starts and stops Vite automatically
```

For debugging locally, run `npm run test:e2e -- --headed`.
GitHub Actions runs the existing **Lint, format, and test** check and the new
**Playwright smoke test** check on each PR to `main`.

A repository admin must mark both job checks as required under the `main`
branch protection rule (or repository ruleset) before a failing test can
prevent merging. Use the exact check names above after an initial PR run.
